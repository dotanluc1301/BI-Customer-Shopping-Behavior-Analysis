1. Revenue Trends (Monthly/Yearly)\
  Chart Type: Combo Chart (Line + Bar)\
    Primary axis (Bars): Monthly revenue\
    Secondary axis (Line): Cumulative yearly revenue or growth rate %\
  Attributes Needed:\
    Date (formatted to Month-Year)\
    Total_Amount (aggregated as SUM)\
  What to Focus On:\
    Seasonal patterns: Identify peak and low months\
    Growth trajectory: Is revenue increasing, stable, or declining?\
    Year-over-year comparison: If you want to show Mar-Dec 2023 vs Jan-Feb 2024 patterns\
    Add a trend line to visualize overall direction\
  Consider adding: Month-over-month growth rate as a secondary metric\
  Recommendations:\
    Use color coding: Green for months exceeding average, red for below average\
    Add data labels for the top 3 and bottom 3 months\
    Include a reference line for monthly average revenue\
\
2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\
  Chart Type: Grouped Bar Chart or Heat Map\
    Option A - Grouped Bar Chart: Compare average CLV across different segments side-by-side\
    Option B - Heat Map: Show CLV intensity across multiple dimensions simultaneously\
  Attributes Needed:\
    Customer_ID (to calculate unique customers)\
    Total_Amount (aggregated as SUM per customer)\
    Customer_Segment\
    State or City (for geographic segmentation)\
    Age, Gender, Income (for demographic segmentation)\
  What to Focus On:\
    High-value segments: Which customer segments generate the most lifetime value?\
    Geographic disparities: Which locations have highest CLV customers?\
    Demographic patterns: Age/income brackets with highest spending\
    Distribution: Are there many small spenders and few big spenders? (Pareto principle)\
  Recommendations:\
    Create multiple views:\
      CLV by Customer_Segment\
      CLV by State/Region (top 10)\
      CLV by Age Group and Gender\
      CLV by Income Bracket\
    Add a count of customers in each segment to show volume vs. value trade-offs\
  Consider a scatter plot: Number of customers (x-axis) vs. Average CLV (y-axis), sized by total revenue contribution\

3. Market Segmentation and Expansion Opportunities\
  Chart Type: Combination of Multiple Charts\
    3a. Demographic Segmentation - Stacked Bar Chart: Revenue contribution by Age Group, Gender, and Income levels\
    3b. Product Performance Matrix - Bubble Chart\
      X-axis: Number of transactions per product category\
      Y-axis: Average transaction value\
        Bubble size: Total revenue\
        Color: Product_Category\
    3c. Geographic Heat Map or Choropleth Map: Revenue by State/City with color intensity\
  Attributes Needed:\
    Demographics: Age, Gender, Income, Customer_Segment\
    Product: Product_Category, Product_Brand, Product_Type\
    Geographic: State, City, Country\
    Revenue: Total_Amount\
    Volume: Transaction_ID (count)\
  What to Focus On:\
    Underserved segments: Demographics with low penetration but high potential\
    Geographic white spaces: Regions with low revenue but high population/income\
    Product-market fit: Which products resonate with which segments?\
    Growth potential: Segments showing increasing transaction frequency\
  Recommendations:\
    Create a 2x2 matrix view:\
      Quadrant 1: High Revenue + High Growth (Invest & Expand)\
      Quadrant 2: High Revenue + Low Growth (Maintain)\
      Quadrant 3: Low Revenue + High Growth (Nurture)\
      Quadrant 4: Low Revenue + Low Growth (Evaluate)\
    Segment analysis table showing:\
      Revenue contribution %\
      Customer count\
      Average order value\
      Purchase frequency\
      Growth rate (if comparing periods)\
\
4. ROI on Marketing and Operations (Efficiency Metrics)\
  Chart Type: Scorecard + KPI Cards + Bar Charts\
    4a. Key Efficiency Metrics (Scorecard/KPI Cards):\
      Revenue per Customer\
      Average Order Value (AOV)\
      Purchase Frequency\
      Customer Acquisition Efficiency (if new vs. returning customers can be identified)\
    4b. Efficiency Comparison Chart - Grouped Bar Chart: Compare metrics across customer segments, regions, or product categories\
  Attributes Needed:\
    Customer_ID (unique count)\
    Transaction_ID (count for frequency)\
    Total_Amount (for revenue calculations)\
    Customer_Segment, State, Product_Category\
    Date (to calculate time-based metrics)\
  What to Focus On:\
    Revenue per Customer: Which segments/regions generate most efficient revenue?\
    Repeat purchase rate: % of customers making multiple purchases\
    Average basket size: Are customers buying more per transaction?\
    Operational efficiency indicators:\
      Revenue per transaction\
      Orders per customer\
      Revenue by shipping method (efficiency of fulfillment)\
  Recommendations:\
    Top section: Large KPI cards showing:\
      Total Revenue\
      Total Customers\
      Revenue per Customer\
      Average Order Value\
      Total Transactions\
      Average Transactions per Customer\
    Comparison view: Bar chart showing revenue per customer by:\
      Customer Segment\
      Top 10 States\
      Product Category\
    Trend analysis: Line chart showing monthly trends of:\
      Revenue per Customer\
      Average Order Value\
      These show if efficiency is improving over time\
  Add calculated fields:\
    Revenue per Customer = SUM(Total_Amount) / COUNT_DISTINCT(Customer_ID)\
    AOV = SUM(Total_Amount) / COUNT(Transaction_ID)\
    Purchase Frequency = COUNT(Transaction_ID) / COUNT_DISTINCT(Customer_ID)\
